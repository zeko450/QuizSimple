QuizSimple. A fun application used to take quizzes on general knowledge.  
You can make your own quiz and choose how many questions there will be.  
You can also choose the difficulty (Easy, Medium, Hard) for each question.  
At the end, you can check your grade, your mistake and the correct answer.
